# RegularisationAcrossLinguisticLevels

# This text file explains 'Saldanaetal2018LLD_experimental_data.csv' (experimental data) and 'Saldanaetal2018LLD_questionnaire_data.csv' (post-experiment questionnaires data), the supporting data files for the experiments in the submitted manuscript ’Is regularisation uniform across linguistic levels? Comparing learning and production of unconditioned probabilistic variation in morphology and word order'.

In `Saldanaetal2018LLD_experimental_data.csv’, the descriptions of the column headings are as follows:

Experiment -- type of production task, isolate production ('ISO') or dyadic interaction ('DYAD')
Condition -- experimental condition ('Morphology', 'Word Order', 'NoL1 Word Order', 'Morphology Dyads' and 'Word Order Dyads')
DyadID -- the ID number of a Dyad (applicable to 'DYAD' only)
ParticipantID -- the ID number of each individual participant. In 'DYAD' experiments, ParticipantID is the same as the Dyad ID with an additional number at the end, either 1 or 2, that indicates each of the participants within the dyad.
Phase -- the experimental phase (analyses of output languages are run in 'testing_all' data)
Meaning -- the object displayed
InputSentence -- the description displayed along the object during training
RT -- reaction time (the time passed between initial display and button click)
MeaningSelection -- the object selected in the picture-selection tasks during training and/or matching trails during communication
OutputSentence -- description entered
CorrectedOutput -- proposed correction of output sentence to match input lexicon (corrected output was only used to replace identifiable typos)
Grammatical -- presence of the displayed description in the input language
GrammaticalityJudgment -- participants's judgment of whether the displayed description was present in the input language during training
Timestamp -- time of data collection
 

In `Saldanaetal2018LLD_questionnaire_data.csv’, the descriptions of the column headings are as follows:

Experiment -- type of production task, isolate production ('ISO') or dyadic interaction ('DYAD')
Condition -- experimental condition ('Morphology', 'Word Order', 'NoL1 Word Order', 'Morphology Dyads' and 'Word Order Dyads')
ParticipantID -- the ID number of each individual participant
InputMajNumOnly -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority Num Only variant (actual input was 0.6)
InputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority Adj Only variant (actual input was 0.6)
InputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority two-modifier variant (actual input was 0.6)
OutputMajNumOnly -- participant's estimated output frequency (i.e. in production) for majority Num Only variant 
OutputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated output frequency for majority Adj Only variant 
OutputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated output frequency for majority two-modifier variant 
CommentsChoice -- participant's comments on the strategy they use to choose variants
LanguagesSpoken -- languages spoken by the participant
Timestamp -- time of data collection


NB Estimates for output proportions are not used in the analysis in the paper; they were collected to check that participants do not introduce the same proportions for input and output estimated frequencies systematically.
